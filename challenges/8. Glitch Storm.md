# **Challenge 8: "Glitch Storm"**

Building on the success of the **Power Trip** challenge, you are once again faced with the same challenge. The goal remains the same, **trigger a voltage glitch to enter a hidden code path and retrieve the flag**.

However, the catch this time is that the glitch trigger is no longer the obvious SDA pin. You must **discover the new trigger pin and timing** to successfully glitch the device.

**Your mission is clear:**

1. **Analyze the device to identify the new glitch trigger.**  
2. **Precisely time and inject the voltage glitch at the discovered trigger.**  
3. **Access the hidden code block and extract the flag over UART.**
