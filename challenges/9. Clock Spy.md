# **Challenge 9: "Clock Spy"**

You’ve uncovered a high-security vault guarded by a keypad that requires a 5-digit PIN. When the PIN is entered and the OK button pressed, the system checks the password internally.

Your task is to perform a **timing side-channel attack** to recover the PIN as quickly and efficiently as possible. But beware — the PIN **changes every time the device reboots**, adding an extra layer of complexity to your attack.

> **Disclaimer:**  
> Normally, side-channel attacks require expensive equipment such as oscilloscopes and specialized tooling like a ChipWhisperer. However, we have intentionally added specific delays so these attacks can be performed using a **very affordable logic analyzer**.

**Your mission is clear:**

1. **Observe and measure timing variations** during the PIN verification process.  
2. **Use side-channel analysis techniques** to deduce each digit of the PIN.  
3. **Recover the correct 5-digit PIN before the device resets.**  
4. **Retrieve the flag via UART at 9600 baud rate.**
