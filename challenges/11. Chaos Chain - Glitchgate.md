# **Challenge 11: "Chaos Chain: Glitchgate"**

Welcome to the **Glitchgate** arena, where you get no schematics, no source code, and only the bare device in front of you. Your goal is to break in by chaining multiple hardware attack techniques.

This challenge combines two major hurdles:  
- An **obscure UART baud rate** that you must identify to establish communication.  
- A **fault injection attack** that bypasses the UART login screen, granting unauthorized access.

Youâ€™ll need to carefully analyze the device, discover the correct UART settings, and time your glitch precisely to defeat its defenses.

**Your mission is clear:**

1. **Identify the obscure UART baud rate** used by the device.  
2. **Bypass the UART login screen** via a fault injection.  
3. **Gain control of the device and retrieve the flag through the UART interface.**
