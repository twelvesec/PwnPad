# **Challenge 12: "Chaos Chain: Timebomb"**

In this final Black Box CTF challenge, the device steps up the difficulty:  
- The **UART pins have been relocated**, so you must manually identify the correct pins.  
- The UART communication runs at a **non-common baud rate**, adding an extra layer of complexity.  
- After establishing communication, you must perform a **timing side-channel attack** to extract the secret.

Only the most persistent and observant hackers will succeed.

**Your mission is clear:**

1. **Identify the relocated UART pins** through careful probing.  
2. **Determine the obscure UART baud rate** used by the device.  
3. **Perform a timing side-channel attack** to retrieve the hidden flag via UART.
