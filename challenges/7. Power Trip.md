# **Challenge 7: "Power Trip"**

You’ve discovered a device that appears locked down tight, every known interface rejects your commands. But somehow you find a **code block that’s never supposed to execute**, likely due to built-in protection checks. 

By carefully injecting a **voltage glitch** at the right moment, you might be able to **bypass those checks** and force the device into revealing its hidden path. The **SDA pin** serves as your glitch trigger, and if successful, the device will spill the flag over **UART @ 9600 baudrate**.

**Your mission is clear:**

1. **Identify the timing window** during which to trigger the voltage glitch.  
2. **Inject a glitch using the SDA pin as your trigger source.**  
3. **Access the dead code block** and retrieve the flag via UART at 9600 baudrate.
