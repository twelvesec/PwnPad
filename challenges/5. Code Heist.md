# **Challenge 5: "Code Heist"**

In a high-tech underground bunker, you've stumbled upon a **security keypad** linked to a classified device. The rumors suggest that entering a **hidden password** will unlock a **secret mode**, but there’s a catch—the password isn’t documented anywhere.

However, your investigation reveals that the device’s firmware is stored in the internal **Flash memory**, and there’s a chance that the password is hardcoded within. If you can extract the firmware, you just might be able to pull off the ultimate **code heist**.

**Your mission is clear:**

1. **Dump the firmware** from the internal Flash memory using available debugging or ISP interfaces.  
2. **Analyze the firmware binary** to locate and recover the hardcoded password.  
3. **Use the password on the keypad** to unlock the device’s secret mode and retrieve the flag.
