# **Challenge 3: "Bus Whisperer"**

Deep inside an abandoned research lab, youâ€™ve discovered a prototype security device. It appears to be communicating with hidden components over an **I2C bus**. The traffic is silent to the untrained eye, but with the right tools, you can eavesdrop on the device's conversations and uncover what it's hiding.

**Your mission is clear:**

1. **Identify the I2C communication lines** used by the device.  
2. **Identify all connected I2C devices** the system is interacting with.  
3. **Retrieve** the hidden message embedded in the communication.
