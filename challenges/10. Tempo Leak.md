# **Challenge 10: "Tempo Leak"**

This challenge builds on the mechanics of **Clock Spy**, but with a twist. The device now uses a **4-digit PIN**, and the password verification is only triggered **after all four digits have been entered**.

Your goal remains a **timing side-channel attack** to recover the PIN. The change in input handling means youâ€™ll need to adjust your analysis techniques accordingly.

**Your mission is clear:**

1. **Capture and analyze timing data** during the full 4-digit PIN entry.  
2. **Leverage timing variations** to deduce the complete PIN.  
3. **Recover the PIN and bypass the security check.**  
4. **Retrieve the flag via UART at 9600 baud rate.**
