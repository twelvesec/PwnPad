# **Challenge 2: "Echo Chamber"**

Following the success of your first infiltration, you've intercepted another device from the same syndicate. This one seems almost identical — same pinout, same behavior — but something’s off. Your usual tools can’t make sense of the UART output. It looks like the engineers behind this one were clever enough to **obfuscate communication by using a non-standard baud rate**.

The challenge is a test of patience and precision. You'll need to **analyze the signal itself** to get in.

**Your mission is clear:**

1. **Identify the UART pins** using your probing tools.
2. **Determine the correct (non-standard) baud rate** via signal analysis.
3. **Establish a reliable terminal connection** and extract the flag from the interface.
